# Claw for [lobste.rs](https://lobste.rs) [![CI](https://github.com/msfjarvis/compose-lobsters/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/msfjarvis/compose-lobsters/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

Unofficial Android app for read-only access to [lobste.rs](https://lobste.rs), built with [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose).

> [!WARNING]
> This app uses a JSON API that Lobsters does not expose by choice and [the maintainer has no interest in having](https://github.com/lobsters/lobsters/issues/1663#issuecomment-3074472781), so it may break in any manner at any point in time. File an issue [here](https://github.com/msfjarvis/compose-lobsters/issues?q=sort%3Aupdated-desc+is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen) if you come across any bugs, do not bother the upstream developers about a feature they don't support.
