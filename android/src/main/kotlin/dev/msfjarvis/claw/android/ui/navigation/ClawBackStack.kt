 * Naive implementation of a simple navigation back stack, backed by a

 *
 * Using a [java.util.Stack] would've made the API ridiculously simpler, but we would lose all the
 * cool Compose benefits.
 *
 * Stacks function in a completely opposite order of lists, which means when you call
 * first/firstOrNull on a stack, you expect to receive the item you added *last*, since stacks add
 * to the front while lists add behind. To counter these expectations with the actual backing data
 * structure, many APIs in this class inverse of identically named functions on [List].
