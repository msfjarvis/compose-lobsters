/**
 * Neato workaround for not allowing the [dev.msfjarvis.claw.database.LobstersDatabase] type to be
 * used directly by modules that depend on this one, as we prefer them to use the specific types
 * from [QueriesModule] instead. A [Qualifier] applied to the
 * [dev.msfjarvis.claw.database.LobstersDatabase] type makes all injection sites require it as well,
 * and marking the annotation class' visibility as `internal` lets it stay visible to the Java code
 * generated by Dagger but inaccessible by the Kotlin code we're writing ourselves.
